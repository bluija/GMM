# Graphical Models Project

We adapted the code in https://github.com/zashwood/glm-hmm and implemented a custom EM algorithm in https://github.com/bluija/GMM/blob/main/2_fit_models/fit_individual_glmhmm%20em/glm_hmm_utils.py 

To enable the code to run on a laptop, we also tweaked the hyperparameters. The instructions to run the code are in the original README at https://github.com/zashwood/glm-hmm/blob/main/README.md.
